# Ansible

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In normal operation, the lab uses zero Ansible.

We only use Ansible for bootstrapping the first node of the cluster. Tinkerbell then takes over.

Yes, you did read that correctly; we actually do not use Ansible whatsoever.

To rebuild the cluster, please see [bootstrap](../bootstrap/README.md).
